  graphTitle: 'Estimated count^10 of microplastic particles',
  extent: 'We still do not know the true extent of microplastics\' impacts on human health, especially when these particles could interact with other environmental pollutants or contaminants that we are exposed to. However, researchers estimate that human microplastics consumption ranges from 39,000 to 52,000 PARTICLES and traces of micro- and nanoplastics have been found in human organs.',
  harm: 'One potentially serious harm posed to humans is due to plastic’s ability to accumulate contaminants like PCBs and pesticides, which then might leach into our bodies once the particles are ingested.',
  final: 'We still have a lot to learn about how microplastic impact human health, but when it comes to our health and our family’s health, it is best to steer towards the side of caution.',
  dinner: 'Microplastics ingested by sea creatures can eventually end up on our own dinner plates, whether it’s a platter of tuna sushi, a plate of mussels, or a tilapia filet.',
  eat: 'As the last stop in this long ocean food chain, humans are susceptible to the consequences of plastic pollution, just like the fish we eat.',
