  plasticAmount: 'The world’s surface oceans contain almost 270,000 tons of plastics ',
  surfaceOceans: 'Since the majority of marine animals live near the surface of the ocean, you can imagine that this much plastic in the main stretch of their habitat can cause some serious issues.',
  suzie: 'THIS IS SUZIE THE SEA TURTLE.',
  endangered: 'There are only SEVEN species of sea turtles in the world, and nearly all of them are ENDANGERED.',
  journey: 'Suzie is making the 1,500 mile journey to lay her eggs on the very same beach where she was born.',

  threat: 'But the long distance is not the only obstacle she faces. There is an even greater threat looming...',
  story: 'Suzie’s story is not unique. Thousands of sea turtles in U.S. waters die due to ocean plastic pollution every year.',
  others: 'Some encounter the same plight as Suzie, while many others die from plastic ingestion.',
  caught: 'It’s easy for sea turtles to mistake a plastic bag for a jellyfish or unintentionally get caught in packaging waste.',
  hatchlings: 'And Suzie’s hatchlings are particularly vulnerable',
  baby: 'Just one piece of plastic can be enough to kill a baby sea turtle.',
  actions: 'Without actions to reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans, we risk losing these beautiful creatures that grace our American beaches.',
